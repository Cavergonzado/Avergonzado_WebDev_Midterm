<p> Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people. It is a stronger <br> form of interpersonal bond than an association, and has been studied in academic <br> fields such as communication, sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and <br> philosophy.</p>

<h1><a href="https://quote.com/blog/77-perfect-love-quotes/"> Love</a></h1>
<img src="wp3299483.jpg" alt="Two kids image">
<p>The best and most beautiful things in this world cannot be seen or even heard, <br> but must be felt with the heart. Life without love is like a tree without blossoms <br> or fruit. The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. 'Tis better to have loved <br> and lost than never to have loved at all.</p>
